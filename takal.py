"""ALGORITHM FOR DEVELOPING THE GAME"""


"""1. Initialize game parameters (player balance, bet amount)

2. Display possible betting options (HH, HT, TH, TT)

3. Accept player's bet choice and amount

4. Validate bet amount (must be positive and â‰¤ player balance)

5. Simulate two independent coin tosses using random number generation

6. Determine the outcome combination

7. Compare outcome with player's bet

8. Adjust player balance based on result

9. Display results and new balance

10. Ask if player wants to play again"""
